# Metapolis

## Overview

Metapolis's official repository contains two primary components: the SQL Sail integration and the Advanced Semantic Map. These components enable Metapolis to manage and visualize complex geospatial data by integrating a PostgreSQL database with PostGIS for geospatial queries and analysis.

## Requirements

It requires the branch [build-docker/metapolis](https://github.com/researchspace/researchspace/tree/build-docker/metapolis). Also available as a docker image (e.g., `docker pull researchspace/platform-ci:metapolis`) See [Docker Hub](https://hub.docker.com/r/researchspace/platform-ci/tags).
